# tic-tac-toe

This web game was made to fulfill the Tic Tac Toe project as part of The Odin Project.

The 'Computer Easy' opponent chooses a random open slot.
The 'Computer Hard' opponent chooses a slot that gives it the highest liklihood of winning. It uses a minimax algorithm to decide where to play.

This code has not been refactored for legibility. It was built quick and dirty.
