This web game was made to fulfill the Tic Tac Toe project as part of The Odin Project.

The 'Computer Easy' opponent chooses a random open slot.
THe 'Computer Hard' opponent chooses a slot that gives it the highest liklihood of winning. It uses a minimax algorithm to decide where to play.

This code has not been refactored for legibility. It was built quick and dirty with an emphasis on dividing functionality into small re-usable functions.

I wrote code just shy of two months into my journey learning to be a developer.
